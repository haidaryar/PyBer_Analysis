# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview

Performed an in-depth analysis of PyBer's ride-sharing services delivered in urban, suburban, and rural areas. In this analysis we took a deep dive into PyBer's services between January 2019 and April 2019. 

## Revenue

Data indicates that most revenue is generated in urban areas. While the total collected fare does slightly fluctuate for urban areas, at no point between January and May the total fare dips enough to go below or level with suburban and/or rural areas. Witin the aforementioned timeline, a consistent trend in generating the highest revenue is visible from the services provided in the urban areas. 

## Summary

### Rural Areas

Rural areas had 125 total rides | 78 total drivers | $4,327.93 collected in total fare | Average fare per ride is: $34.62. | Average fare per Driver is: $55.49. 

### Suburban Areas

Suburban areas had 625 total rides | 490 total drivers | $19,356.33 collected in total fare | Average fare per ride is: $30.97 | Average fare per driver is: $39.50.

### Urban Areas

Urban areas had 1625 total rides | 2,405 total drivers | 39,854.38 collected in total fare | average fare per ride is $24.53 | average fare per driver is $16.57

## Recommendations

Based on the data and considering the limitations, I have the following recommendations:

1. PyBer needs to invest in getting demand projections for all three city types of cities. Subsequently by providing incentives to drivers they can reassign them to an area where demand happens to be higher. Based on the data that we have available; average fare per ride for rural areas is higher than urban and suburban areas but there may not be a demand to justify reassigning drivers there. However, the average fare per ride in suburban areas is higher by $6.44 than rural areas, if there is a higher demand in suburban areas it would be worth reassigning drivers there with providing appropriate incentives. 
2. Getting distance data for each ride is essential in making sound business decisions. I recommend we make some adjustments that accommodates it. 
3. Lastly, I recommend we perform anaysis of holiday season (Nov-Dec) to get a better understanding of revenue as well as demand in relation to regular months of the year.
